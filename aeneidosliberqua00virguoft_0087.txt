APPENDIX OF GRAMMATICAL
PECULIARITIES

..44-

In Latin poetry you will find many variations from the
common language of prose, and also a more frequent use of
such variations as prose itself admits.

Ι. For instance, the following will be found in any prose
author, but far more frequently in poetry:

(a) Omission of sum, est, δῖα, especially in the past tenses,
passive and deponent (see l. 151).

(b) Short forms of verbs, especially the third plural of
the perfect indicative active. (Cf. also crstinum,
exstimati, inplessem, admorunt.)

(c) Use of participle agreeing with substantive or pronoun
understood (cf. non adversata petenti, l. 127).

(d) Adjective qualifying a verb like an adverb (see
1. 289).

ΙΙ, The following peculiarities again are more strictly
confined to poetry:

(a) Use of plural for singular, especially nos and noster
for eqo and meus. This is very frequent, and there
are many instances in this book, which are easily
discoverable by common sense. Thus there are
three in ll. 196, 197, 199.

(b) Prepositions put after their case : see ll. 240, 255, 671.

(c) Cases used without a preposition : sec 11. 32, 106, 124.

(d) Transitive verbs used intransitively: see ll. 225, 251,

565·
ΙΙΙ. Vergil is particularly fond of varying ordinary phrases

(see ll. 142, 463, &c.); and above all of using tho cases,

especially the ablativo, in peculiar ways. Instancos will be
found in the following list.
