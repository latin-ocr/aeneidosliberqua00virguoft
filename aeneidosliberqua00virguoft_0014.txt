2 VERGIL'S AENEID lv

which was never good, broke down, and he died towards
the end of Β. C. 19. He was buried close to Naples.

In character he was gentle, modest, and genereus.
That he was modest is shown by the story of his desii-ing

an imperfect work.

VERGIL’S Womzs.

The three works which gained for Vergil his reputation
as a poet are (1) The Bucolics, (2) The Geofflcs, (3) The
Aenee'd.

Tho Bucolica or Ecloyues, are ten short poems on country
life, largely in the form of dialogues or conversations
between shepherds. They are imitated from a Greek
poet, and do not give a real account of country life in
Italy: but they have a charm of their own, and the
versification was smoother and more musical than that
of previous Latin poetry. The fourth Eclogue was long
supposed to contain a prophecy of the Messiah.

The Georyics are four books on country occupations,
namely the cultivation of land, breeding of cattle,
cultivation of 116637 and hee-keeping. All these Vergil
was well fitted to discuss owing to his early surroundings ;
and the language in which he has expressed himself is
more finished and beautiful than that of the Bucolics or
even the Aeneid itself.

The Aeneia was his last and is his most famous work.
Like Homer's Iliad, which it imitates 111 many ways, it
is an epic poem, or poem of adventures. But it has
a ‘moralj which the Iliad has not, and the moral is the
glory of Rome. It is a deliberate attempt, due partly to
the suggestion of Augustus, partly no doubt to Vergil‘s
own υἱώ-10113111. 10 make the Roman proud of his empire
