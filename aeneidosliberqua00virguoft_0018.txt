6 VERGIL'S AENEID 1v

speeches of Dido, first pathetic, then furiouslythreatening;
also to the description of her growing love, and to the
narration of the horrors which urge her to her miserable
end. There is also the fatal part played by the gentle
Anna in hastening the catastrophe : it is she who induces
Dido to yield to her love, and who prepares the pyre for
her sister's death3 and she has to endure the reproaches
and jealousy of Dido, and to perform the thankless task
of trying to make Aeneas relent.

SPECIMENS or TRANSLATION.

Dryden, who wrote in the seventeenth century, and
William Morris, who is only recently dead, are perhaps
the most well-known poets who have translated the
Aeneid. Dryden is so free as to 116 frequently incorrect;
Morris 30 literal and old-fashioned in language as to be
often cramped and unmusical. The following are their
respective translations of ll. 615—629 :—

Yet let a race untam’d, and haughty foes,

His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose 3
Oppress’d with numbers in th' unequal field,
His men discourag'd, and himself expell'd 3
Let him for succour fly from place to place,
Το1·11 from his subjects and his son's embrace :
First let him see 1113 friends in battle 313111,
And their untimely fate lament in vain :

And when, at length, the cruel war shall 66336,
011 1131·(1 conditions may he buy his peace.

Nor let him then enjoy supreme command,
But fall untimely by some hostile hand,

And lie unbury’d on the barren sand.

These are my prayers, and this my dying will :
And you, my Tyrians, every curse fulfil ;
Perpetual hate, and mortal wars proclaim
Against the prinoe, the people, and the name.
