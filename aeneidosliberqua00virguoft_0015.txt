INTRODUCTION 3

by connecting its history with the heroes of old. With
this purpose Vergil dwells much on the antiquity of his
country’s religion and customs; and in the sixth book
he makes Aeneas meet Anchises in the under-world and
hear him prophetically rehearse the deeds that were to
win the empire. Throughout the story of Aeneas’ ad-
ventures the pomp and majesty of Rome is consta-ntly
alluded to, and the triumph of the nation shown to be
secure through the protection and favour of the gods.
Shakespeare’s historica] plays did the same for English
patriotism. Compare for instance John of Gaunt’s
famous speech in Richard H, ii. Ι, with such lines as
229-231 in the fourth book of the Aeneid.

VERGIL’S FAME.

While he was alive Vergil was recognized by his
contemporaries as the greatest of all Latin poets, and he
has always been so regarded by the world. But he is
generally admitted to hold a high position among the
poets of all ages and countries3 and this reputation is
’ due mainly to two qualities‚ firstly his wide sympathy
with the feelings and troubles of mankind. secondly the
perfection of his language. He can be either simple or
elaborate, but in each case his phrases are such as only
a true poet could have written3 they are not merely
neat, but appeal to the imagination as well as the heart
and intellect. Our own poet Tennyson speaks of his
work as containing

All the chosen coin of fancy

0 Flashing out from many a golden phrase .—-
and’ All the charm of all the Muses

Often flowering in a lonely w‹›rd.
