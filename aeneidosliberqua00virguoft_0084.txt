72 VERGIL'S AENEID 1v

according to the story in the later books of the Aeneid.
Aeneas had to fight hard and lose many of his comrades
before he got a secure footing in Italy, and even then he
had to abandonlthe Trojan for the Latin name, reigned
only a short time, and did not receive a proper burial. Yet
his object of founding a kingdom was after all accomplished.
VSOEen Charles Ι tried to discover his future at Oxford by
opening a Vergil at random (sortes Verqilicmae), he lighted on
these terrible lines.
