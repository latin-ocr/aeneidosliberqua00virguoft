PREFACE

-44—

Fon the notes to this edition Ι have relied mainly
on Forbiger, Conington, and Sidgwick. It will be
noticed that I have quoted several of Mr. Sidgwiek's
happy translations: though his edition is intended
for older boys, its notes have a olearness and power
of stimulating interest, of which I can only hope
some trace may be found in my own.
