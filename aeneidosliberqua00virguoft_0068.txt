56 VERGIL'S AENEID IV

167. ignes: i.e. lightning.

conscius, ‘ which was aware of.’

168. conubiis: dative depending on conscius. For scansion,
see 1. 126.

169. primus . . . causa. fuit, ‘was the first which brought
about.'

175. mobilitate . . . eundo: ablatives of cause.

176. metu: ablative of cause.

primo: adverbial.

178. deorum: objective genitive, ‘ anger ayaz'nst the gods’3
an unusual example, because ira is not derived from a
transitive verb. Earth was the mother of the Titans and
the giants. Both were punished for rebellion against the
gods. Coeus was a Titan, Enceladus a giant.

181. cui: possessive dative (see l. 138), ‘who for everyfeather
. . . has.’ In the next line sunt is understood with oculi 3 and
then Vergil, aiming as usual at variety, uses different verbs
with ora and aures, instead of merely repeating sunt.

182. subter: i.e. there was an eye under every feather.

mirabile dictu: a common use of supine with neuter
adjective in apposition to the sentence: see horrendum dictu,
1. 454-

184. medio: adjective used as substantive, ‘in the part
between,’ ‘ between '3 not an ordinary use of medius.

186. luce=clie, contrasted with nocte above.

custos: part of the predicate3 ‘as sentinel‚’ i.e. nothing
escapes her notice.

188. ficti pravique . . . veri: used as substantives, and to
be translated as such.

tam . . . quam: lit. ‘as much . . . as,' so ‘equally. . . and:
or ‘both . . . and.’

190. For this use of cano see l. 14.

191. venisse Aenean, δῖα, depends on canebat.

192. vii-0, ‘to whom as a husband.’

dignetur is subjunctive because the relative clause comes
in an indirect statement.

193. hiemem . . . quam longa: lit. ‘ the winter as long as
it is' (est understood), so=the whole winter. Vergil may
have been thinking of Antony and Cleopatra.

luxu: adverbial ablative of manner: see fuya 1. 155, *metu
l. 164.

196. cursus: objective. Note the common poetic use of
plural for singulam see 1. 199.

198. hic: i.e. Iarbas

satus has the same sense as cretus, l. 191.
