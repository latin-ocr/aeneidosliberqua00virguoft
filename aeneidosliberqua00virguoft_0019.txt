INTRODUCTION 7

These grateful offerings on my grave bestow,

Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know ;

Now, and from hence in every future age,

When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies
the rage,

Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood ;

With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood:

Our arms, our seas, our shores oppos'd to theirs,

And the same hate descend on all our heirs.

 

Yet let him faint mid weapon-strife and hardy folk of war ἔ
And let him, exiled from his house, torn from Iulus, wend,
Beseeching help mid wretched death of many and many

a friend.

And when at last he yieldeth him to pact of grinding peace,

Then short-lived let his lordship be, and loved life’s increase.

And let him fall before his day, unburied on the shore 1

Lo this Ι pray, this last of words forth with my blood Ι pour.

And ye, Ο Tyrians, 'gainst his rac-e that is, and is to be,

Feed full your hate Σ When Ι am dead send down this gift
to me :

No love between the peoples twain, no troth for anything Ζ

And thou, Avenger of my wrongs, from my dead bones out-
spring,

Το bear the fire and the sword o'er Dardan-peopled earth

Now or hereafter 3 whensoe’er the day brings might to birth.

Ι pray the shore against the shore, the sea against the sea,

The sword ’gainst sword—fight ye that are, and ye that are
to be Σ
