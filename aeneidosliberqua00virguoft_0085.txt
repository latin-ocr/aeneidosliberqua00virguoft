NOTES 73

644. interfusa. genas= accusative of respect or part affected ;
see 1. 395. Not quite like accusative in l. 137. ‘ Her cheeks
stained here and there with a dark fiush.'

morte: causal ablative.

647. munus: in apposition to ensem ε apparently Dido had
asked Aeneas to give her a sword as a present, though at the
time she had no thought of using it thus.

649. lacrimis et mente: an example of Vergil's free use
of the ablative (see note, 1. 32). ‘ In tears and thought.'

651. dulces is qualified by clumfata, &c.

653. The antecedent is put in the relative clause, as often
in Latin.

655. mea. is emphatic.

659. os inpressa: see 1. 137, note.

660. sic, sic. Dido is here supposed to stab herself twice.

661. iguem: i. e. the burning of the funeral pyre, which
would be an unlucky omen for Aeneas to see as he started on
his voyage.

alto: substantive.

663. ferro ι ablative of place, ‘ on the sword..'

666. bacchatur: see l. 301.

667. femineo ululatu: see note 1. 235.

670. Carthage was stormed by the Romans in 146 B.c.‚ and
its capture, as well as that of Tyre by Alexander the Great in
332 B. c., was attended by frightful slaughter. So also was
the storming of Jerusalem by Titus in 70 A. D„ of Drogheda by
Cromwell, of Magdeburg by Tffly, of Badajoz by Wellington.

671. culmina. is of course governed hyper, and goes with
both hominum and deorum.

675. hoc illud, ‘ was this thy purpose.⁹

fraude = ablative of manner3 may be translated by adverb.

678. vocasses expresses a wish3 ‘would that you had':
so also tulisset.

679. ferro: instrumental ablative.

680. struxi: royum understood.

681. sic te . . . posita, ‘whilst thou didst lie in such plight.’

683. date . . . abluam . . . leg-am: indirect command with
ut omitted3 ‘ grant that I may ’; sce l. 635.

689. stridit . . . volnus. It is best to take volnus as mean-
ing the sword, for, as Mr. Sidgwick points out, strideo or strido
(each form is common) is used of harsh grating sounds.

690. sese is object both of attollens and levavit.
