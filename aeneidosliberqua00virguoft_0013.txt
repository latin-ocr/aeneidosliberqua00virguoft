VERGIL'S LIFE.

Ἴ PUBLms VERGILIUS MARo was born in B. c. 70, near
Mantua in Nol-thern Italy, then called Gallia Cisalpina.
His home was a country one, his father owning a small
estate and farm, and his fondness for the country never
left him. He received a very good educa-tion, first at
Cremona and Mediolanum (now Milan), afterwards at
Naples and probably Rome. Then we may suppose he
went back to his father's farm, but we know nothing
certain about him till Β. c. 42. In that year Octavianus,
afterwards the Emperor Augustus, defeated Brutus and
Cassius at Philippi, and on returning to Italy proceeded
to reward his soldiers by giving them presents of land.
Vergil's home was to have been seized for this purpose,
but Vergil appealed to Octavianus and saved it.

This led to his introduction to the court of Augustus,
where he soon became a favour-ite, for Augustus and his
chief adviser Maecenas were very attentive to all well-
educated and literary men who came under their notice.
Maecenas induced him to write the Georgics, and it was
at the request of Augustus that he undeitook the Aeneid.
One of his best friends (and he had many) was the poet
Horace, whom he introduced to Maecenas. He lived
mainly at Rome and Naples, but in Β. C. 20 he went for
a short visit to Greece. On returning to Italy his health.
