66 VERGIL'S AENEID 1v

446. in Tartara, ‘towards the underworld’; i.e. it reaches
as far below the ground as it does above it.

44 . lacrimae: i. e. Dido’s. ᾹεΝεΑδ

manes: to be taken with the verb, predicative: see ima, 1. 24.

452. quo magis: final. It expresses the purpose of
the gods.

457. in tectis, . ‚templum : i. e. a small shrine or chapel
sacred to the memory of Sychaeus.

460, 461. voces . . . verba . . . visa (sunt): notice that the
participle, though one of the two subjects is feminine, is put
in the neuter because the subjects are abstract inanimate
things. Or you may say that visae sunt is understood
with voces. Notice the alliteration ; see 1. 216 and AppendiX.

462. cuhninibus: ablative of place.

463. queri . . . ducere either depend on visa est understood,
or are historic infinitives (see 1. 422).

in fletum: this would be cum'fletu in prose3 it may be
translated by an adverb.

ducere: see 1. 560.

468. She dreams that she is abandoned, not only by
Aeneas, but by her Carthaginian subjects also.

deserta. . . . terra: either local ablative or ablative absolute.

469. Pentheus, King of Thebes, was driven mad by Dio-
nysus or Bacchus for refusing to allow his worship at
Thebes, and was torn in pieces by his mother and some
bacchantes who were inspired with frenzy by Bacchus.
His madness made him see double.

470. solem . . . se ostendere Thebas: accusative with
infinitive depending on videt.

471. Orestes killed his mother Clytaemnestra because she
had murdered his father Agamemnon. For this he was
pursued by the Furies and (according to Vergil here) by his
mother herself in the guise of a Fury.

scaenis agitatus, ‘hunted on the stage ’3 ablative of place.
Greek plays were much admired by the Romans, and Vergil
is here thinking not so much of the old legends as of their
representation in the theatre in his own day. Hence he
uses the presents, videt, fugit, sedent.

477. spem fronte serenat. The natural expression would
be spe frontem serenat, but Vergil changes it for the sake of
variety. Instead of ‘clears her brow with hope,' we must
say ‘ wears calm hope on her brow.'

479. quae . . . reddat . . . solvat: consecutive, ‘such as
may' : see ll. 229, 329.

me . . . amantem: translate by a relative.
